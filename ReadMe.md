### Links

- Solution URL: (https://replit.com/@TobiDelly/Stats-Preview)
- Live Site URL: (https://stats-preview.tobidelly.repl.co/)

Don't forget to reduce the screen size while viewing the live site because size of the component was set at 1440px which makes it wider

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- VS code and Replit
- CSS Grid
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
